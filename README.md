# LeetCode Solutions - Interview Preparation

My journey solving LeetCode problems to prepare for technical interviews. This repository contains well-documented solutions organized by topic and difficulty level.

## About

This repository serves as a structured collection of my LeetCode problem-solving journey. Each solution is implemented with clean, readable code and includes explanations of the approach, time complexity, and space complexity analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary language for all solutions

## Table of Contents

- [Arrays](./arrays/) - Array manipulation, two pointers, sliding window
- [Strings](./strings/) - String processing, pattern matching
- [Linked Lists](./linked-lists/) - Linked list operations and algorithms
- [Trees](./trees/) - Binary trees, BST, tree traversals
- [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic-programming/) - Optimization problems using DP
- [Graphs](./graphs/) - Graph traversal, shortest path, connectivity

## Progress Tracker

| Problem Name | Difficulty | Date Solved | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
|             |           |             |       |
